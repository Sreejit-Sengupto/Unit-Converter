# Unit-Converter
Web App created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Converts Metric to Imperial system and vice-versa.
Open to contribution, changes are welcomed in appearance and new functionality.

# How to contribute?
* You can add other functionality, like convert from MKS to CGS and vice versa (if you don't know how to do it just look at the index.js file. The code will be exactly the same, you just need to make the required changes to convert MKS to CGS and vice versa). **Your page should follow the same structure as index.html**
* ### IMPORTANT(Check Issues section): Create a landing page where user can see what are the functionality that the website provides and then select the required operation he wants to do and in turn get redirected to the required page.
* Add some visual changes, for example you can add darkmode.
